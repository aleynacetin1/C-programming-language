/*Please write a C program that uses a function "behind()" (which you also have to write) in order to help with this task. Your program should first read, from the user input, the number of players participating in the game. There are never more than 10 players in the game. Next, your program should read the current scores of each player and store them in an array. Then you should call the function behind(), to which you pass as a first argument, the array holding the player's scores, and as a second argument the number of players in the game. The function behind should replace the scores stored in the array with the number of points by which each individual player is behind the top-scoring player.

Example
Input
5

Output
7                                                                               
3
